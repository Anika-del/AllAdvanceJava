 

Certainly! Let's walk through the steps to create a JMS server and a JMS module in WebLogic Server. These components are essential for setting up JMS (Java Messaging Service) resources such as queues and topics. 

Create a Persistent Store: 

Before creating a JMS server, ensure you have a persistent store. A persistent store is used for message persistence and can be shared between sender and receiver servers. 

In the WebLogic Administration Console: 

Navigate to Services > Persistent Stores. 

Click New and select Create FileStore. 

Provide a name (e.g., EndPointFS) and specify the directory location (e.g., /scratch/obdx/wls). 

Click Finish [4]. 

Create a JMS Server: 

JMS servers act as management containers for JMS resources within JMS modules. 

In the WebLogic Administration Console: 

Navigate to Services > Messaging > JMS Servers. 

Click New. 

Provide a name (e.g., ExtXfaceReceiverServer). 

Select the persistent store created earlier (e.g., EndPointFS). 

Set the target to a WebLogic server cluster (e.g., obdx_server1 cluster). 

Click Finish. 

Verify that the JMS server appears in the list with a healthy status [4]. 

Create a JMS Module: 

JMS modules contain JMS resources like queues and topics. 

In the WebLogic Administration Console: 

Navigate to Services > Messaging > JMS Modules. 

Click New. 

Provide a name for the JMS module (e.g., ExtXfaceReceiverModule). 

Set the target (e.g., Obdx_Cluster or any other available cluster). 

Leave the other options empty and click Next. 

Uncheck "Would you like to add resources to this JMS system module" and click Finish [4]. 

That's it! You've successfully created a JMS server and a JMS module. Now you can proceed to define JMS queues and other resources within the module. If you need further assistance or have additional questions, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
